# focusapp-backend

The backend for the *Kent Focus* app built at the Kent State Hackathon.

This is built using MongoDB, Express, and hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance.

## Overcame Problems
Most problems came from actually using Amazon EC2.

To use the Amazon credit from the hackathon, we had to jump through some hoops.

After that was fixed, and installing the packages and stuff, setting up the required ports/security rules so we could test was difficult.
